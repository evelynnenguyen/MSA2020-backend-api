# Deploy .NET Core Web API to Azure
In this tutorial, I will show how to deploy our finished .NET CORE Web API to Azure.

## Development Environment
1. Visual Studio Community 2019, version 16.6.2
2. .NET CORE 3.1
3. Azure Student Subscription

## Deployment
In order to deploy our .NET Core Application to Azure, we need an Azure account with subscription. If you are a student, you can register a student subscription with Microsoft Azure.
Once you are ready with your Azure account, login into [Azure](http://portal.azure.com/) and search for "App Services"
