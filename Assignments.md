# Assignments for API + Database module

## Submission
Students will need to submit a link to GitHub repository. README.md file will contain the following contents:
- All the screenshots and explanations/notes
- URLs of your APIs that have been hosted on Azure

## Project Guidelines
- Create a code-first API server with Azure SQL Database
  - Database:
    - Create another table named "Address" with attributes: StudentId, Street Number, Street, Suburb, City, Postcode and Country. The Student table would have one-to-many relationship with this table. Please assign appropriate datatype for each of the attributes.
    - Show SQL database through the Query editor (screenshots) for both tables with rows of example instances
  - API manipulate the created Azure Database using Code-First migration:
    - Create basic CRUD requests for Student and Address
    - Create an API that add new address for a student using his/her StudentId.
    - Create an API that change the address of a student using his/her StudentId.
    - Screenshot of Swagger UI for each of the CRUD requests with header, body, and successful response status
